# Clicky-Game

**Overview**

This app is build entirely with React. 

1. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

2. The application should render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

3. The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. The game restarts once the user makes an incorrect guess.
